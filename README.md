# AutomationBrigde

> ðŸ’¼ **Commercial Project** â€” internal solution for automated conveyor and PTL systems.

## Overview

**AutomationBrigde** is a .NET Worker Service solution containing two independent background services: **PLCWorker** and **PTLWorker**.

- **PLCWorker** acts as a TCP/IP server for PLC controllers, handling frame processing (SCN, CMD, WDG) and integrating with a SQL database via Dapper to determine package routing.
- **PTLWorker** synchronizes with the PTL system over TCP/IP, sending and receiving messages to coordinate material handling.

Both services are fully asynchronous, DI-friendly, and designed for scalable, maintainable industrial automation environments.
